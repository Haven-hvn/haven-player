## Failure Modes and Mitigations

### Participant leaves
- Action: stop or downgrade policy; finalize file.

### Network interruption
- Tolerate `Disconnected` up to `Tice_grace`; on `Failed`, stop with flush.

### Codec unsupported
- Skip track, continue others; log codec and publication sid.

### No keyframe on late-join
- Send periodic PLI (1s interval, 5 tries); if still none, stop with reason.

### Encoder backpressure
- Drop oldest frames in ring; surface metric; avoid unbounded growth.
